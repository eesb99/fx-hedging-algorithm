# FX Hedging Algorithm - Progress Tracking

## Session: 2025-08-31 (PHASE 1 COMPLETE)

### Major Achievements ‚úÖ
- [x] Complete project setup with conda environment (Python 3.10)
- [x] Live data integration (Yahoo Finance + FRED API)
- [x] Core algorithm operational with real market data
- [x] Academic research validation (Harvey et al. 2025)
- [x] Business application analysis (Malaysian importer use case)
- [x] Comprehensive visualization system
- [x] Fed rate cut scenario analysis

### Technical Implementation ‚úÖ
- [x] **Data Manager**: Real-time MYR/USD from Yahoo Finance
- [x] **FRED API Integration**: Live Fed Funds Rate (4.33%)
- [x] **Signal Engine**: Carry (0.725) + Momentum (0.286) calculations
- [x] **Hedge Calculator**: Dynamic ratio output (52.9%)
- [x] **Visualization**: 4-panel plots, signal history, reports
- [x] **Configuration**: Flexible parameters and API key management

### Real-World Validation ‚úÖ
- [x] **Current Market Data**: MYR/USD 4.2220, validated vs authoritative sources
- [x] **Interest Rate Accuracy**: Fed 4.33% from FRED API, BNM 3.00% manual
- [x] **Business Case Analysis**: MYR 1M importer scenario completed
- [x] **Economic Impact**: Annual hedging cost MYR 7,036, risk scenarios modeled
- [x] **Fed Rate Sensitivity**: 0.25% cut analysis (52.9% ‚Üí 51.1% hedge ratio)

### Academic Foundation Validated ‚úÖ
- [x] **Research Paper**: Harvey et al. (2025) methodology alignment confirmed
- [x] **Signal Validation**: Carry + momentum approach academically proven
- [x] **Dynamic Approach**: Research validates superiority over static hedging
- [x] **Risk Management**: Paper supports "hedge now" recommendation

### Current Operational Status
- **Algorithm**: Fully functional with live data
- **Recommendation**: 52.9% hedge ratio for current market conditions
- **Data Sources**: Yahoo Finance (FX) + FRED API (Fed rates) operational
- **Environment**: conda fx-hedging environment ready for development

### Next Phase Opportunities ‚è≥
- [ ] Historical backtesting framework
- [ ] PPP value signal integration (per research paper)
- [ ] Advanced portfolio optimization (minimum volatility approach)
- [ ] Jupyter notebook analysis templates
- [ ] Web dashboard development

### Key Decisions Made üìã
- **Fed Rate Integration**: FRED API implemented, key stored in ~/.env
- **Algorithm Validation**: Confirmed alignment with academic research
- **Business Application**: Focus on Malaysian importer risk management
- **Hedging Timing**: "Hedge now" recommended over waiting for Fed cut
